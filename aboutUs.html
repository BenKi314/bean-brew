    <p style="margin-left:2vw; margin-right:2vw;">Bean & Brew was founded by Jeremy Elbertson and ███████ █████ in 1983. It got its name from its two recognisable characters, Bean the Bunny and Brew the Bear. See, ███████ and Jeremy had long dreamed of creating a café with lovable mascots that the children could play with and be entertained by, allowing parents of these children to have some time to themselves. The mascots were animatronic in design, with their internal endoskeletons created by Mr. █████. These endoskeletons were designed such that they could be partially removed, allowing an employee to step into the mascot costume if needed for a special event. Things were well for years, until one horrible day, ██/██/87, when a malfunction caused by water damage in Brew caused the costume to revert back to animatronic mode while Mr. █████ was wearing the suit. This was not noticed for several hours, as the internal springs had punctured ███████'s lungs as the incident happened. Out of his family's wishes, his name has been redacted from the history of Bean & Brew. These days, Bean & Brew are only used as mascots in certain promotional material.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:2vw; margin-right:2vw;">The company has moved on from that unfortunate incident, and has rebuilt its reputation with hard work and help from the local community. Next year they will be celebrating their 40th anniversary!</p>
