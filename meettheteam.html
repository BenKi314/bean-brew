            <h1>Sebastian</h1>
            <p>One night, as Jeremy was on his way home, he stumbled upon a small kitten asleep out in the snow. The kind soul that he is, he took the kitten into Bean & Brew, and gave it food, milk and a warm place to stay. Ever since, Sebastian has grown up in the caf√©, and is very friendly with customers. Bean & Brew does offer a pet-free section, for those allergic to cats.</p>
